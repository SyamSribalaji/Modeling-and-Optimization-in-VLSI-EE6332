# Modeling and Optimization in VLSI (EE6332)

Welcome to my repository showcasing my work on digital circuit optimization using gate sizing algorithms. This project focuses on enhancing the performance of digital circuits by optimizing critical metrics such as delay, area, and power consumption.

## How It Works

This project is tailored to work with Verilog files as input. The implemented algorithms parse Verilog files and operate on the circuit described within them. By analyzing the components and connections specified in the Verilog files, the algorithms optimize gate sizes to achieve improved delay, area, and power consumption metrics.

## Implemented Algorithms for Optimal Design

I have developed and implemented gate sizing algorithms using Python. These algorithms play a pivotal role in fine-tuning digital circuits to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization.

## Expertise in Circuit Modeling and Analysis

With a solid foundation in digital circuit modeling and analysis, I've applied these algorithms to real-world scenarios. The algorithms are put to the test using the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, demonstrating my proficiency in understanding and improving circuit behavior.

## In-depth Critical Path Analysis

I've conducted a detailed analysis of critical paths and gate sizes within the circuits. This analysis involves understanding the pathways with the highest impact on performance and ensuring that gate sizes are optimized for efficiency.

## Tailored Area Minimization Strategies

Exploring the intricacies of circuit design, I've researched and developed strategies that focus on minimizing the overall circuit area. These strategies take into account the available slack to make informed decisions during the design process.
